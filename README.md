This is a small library of programs I have done through my educational experiences at NKU. What is listed here is not my complete works as I have more programs that have been written in high school, over 4 years ago.

Comparable.h and lComparable.h
  These were written to highlight the differences between templates and inheritance.
  
DynamicStack.h and DynamicStack.cpp
  For creating a dynamically allocated stack   
  
STLCatalog.cpp
  A catalog with SKU codes as a key for a map data structure.
  
radixSort
  Java program that reads a file and sorts using a radix sort.
